# DFD: Data-privacy-regulation Food Delivery

**Article:** Zijian Zhao, Sen Li\*, "The Impacts of Data Privacy Regulations on Food-Delivery Platforms" (under review)

**Proposal:** Zijian Zhao, "Towards Fairness in Transportation Gig Markets: Identifying, Imitating, and Mitigating Algorithm Discrimination via Deep Reinforcement Learning" (under review, supervised by Prof. Sen Li)

**Acknowledgement:** The code is based on our previous work [RS2002/Discriminatory-Food-Delivery: Official Repository for The Paper, Discriminatory Order Assignment and Payment-Setting on Food-Delivery Platforms: A Multi-Action and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework](https://github.com/RS2002/Discriminatory-Food-Delivery) and the work of [‪Yulong Hu‬](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IfVrhp0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Special thanks to [Yitong Shang](https://yitongshang2021.github.io/) for providing the synthetic food delivery data.

**Notice:** Please note there is a bug in detour time calculation and we will fix it later.

## 2. Dataset & Simulator

Please refer to our previous work [RS2002/Discriminatory-Food-Delivery: Official Repository for The Paper, Discriminatory Order Assignment and Payment-Setting on Food-Delivery Platforms: A Multi-Action and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework](https://github.com/RS2002/Discriminatory-Food-Delivery).

**Notice**: Due to copyright, we only provide the synthetic food delivery data generated by a GAN. Please notice it would be different from the real-world data used in the paper.



## 3. How to Run

### 3.1 Platform Training

#### 3.1.1 Pre-training

```shell
python pretrain_platform.py --probability_worker --rand_sample_rate
```



#### 3.1.2 Fine-tuning

```shell
python finetune_platform.py --probability_worker --demand_sample_rate <order sampling rate> --worker_mode <gdpr/benchmark/mask>
```



### 3.2 Courier Training

```shell
python train_courier.py --probability_worker --model_path <platform_strategy_model_path> --worker_mode <gdpr/benchmark/mask> --lowest_utility <minimum_wage_for_exit_couriers> --demand_sample_rate <order sampling rate>
```



### 3.3 Comparative Evaluation

```shell
python eval.py --probability_worker --gdpr_path <gdpr_model_path> --benchmark_path <benchmark_model_path> --mask_path <mask_model_path> --lowest_utility <minimum_wage_for_exit_couriers> --demand_sample_rate <order sampling rate>
```
